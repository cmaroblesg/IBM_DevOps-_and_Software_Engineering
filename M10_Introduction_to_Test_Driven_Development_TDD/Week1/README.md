# Introduction to Test Driven Development (TDD)
## Introduction to Testing

This module provides an overview of software testing. You will learn about the importance of testing through an example: the development of the Apollo 11 Lunar Moduleâ€™s guidance system. You will discover the numerous problems that occur when developers do not test their code. Then you will explore the four levels of testing and find out when each appears in the traditional release cycle. You will learn what test driven and behavior driven development are and why both are essential for effective testing. You will discover the purpose of test cases and witness their value through a demonstration.

## Learning Objectives
* Explain the importance of testing
* Summarize the problems that occur when developers do not test their code
* Describe each level of the software testing process
* Summarize each phase of the traditional release cycle
* Compare and contrast test driven development (TDD) and behavior driven development (BDD)
* Explain why developers need both TDD and BDD
* Summarize the purpose for using test cases

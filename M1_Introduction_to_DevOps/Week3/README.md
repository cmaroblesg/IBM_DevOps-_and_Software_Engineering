# Working DevOps
## Introduction
This module is all about working using DevOps principles and techniques. You will learn how software development is more like craftwork than factory work and that working in silos leads to mistakes and bottlenecks. You will see how DevOps is driven by behaviors such as collaboration and embracing change. You will be introduced to concepts such as ephemeral infrastructure that emphasizes building quickly and then discarding when that build is no longer needed. You will learn a more effective style of work in which you make changes to container images and redeploy a new container to take its place instead of patching and maintaining it. You will learn about new processes such Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery that enable frequent deployments and working as a team to create high-quality code. You will learn how to move faster, use automation, and spend more time building features and less time debugging during integrations.

## Learning Objectives
* Describe the negative effects of working in silos.
* Recognize why software engineering projects should not be treated like civil engineering projects.
* Describe the behaviors emphasized in DevOps.
* Describe the benefits of using Infrastructure as Code in a DevOps environment.
* Describe how Continuous Delivery enables release to production at any time.
* Describe how Continuous Integration creates more stable code.

## Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
* Taylorism was designed for factory work and software development is bespoke, that is, more like craftwork, and that working in silos leads to mistakes and bottlenecks.
* Team ownership and stable teams make software development more like product development rather than project management.
* Developers want innovation, while Operations want stability.
* Required DevOps behaviors include shared ownership, collaboration, embracing change, and data-driven responses.
* Infrastructure as Code is describing infrastructure in a textual executable format.
* Ephemeral infrastructure can be used and then discarded because servers are built on demand, via automation, using Infrastructure as Code techniques.
* Continuous Integration is building, testing, and integrating every developer change into the master branch after tests have passed.
* The benefits of Continuous Integration include faster reaction time, moving faster, and reducing the risk in integrating code.
* Continuous Delivery ensures that code can be rapidly and safely deployed to production by delivering every change to a production-like environment.
* The five principles of Continuous Delivery have to do with quality, working in small batches, automation, continuous improvement, and shared responsibility.

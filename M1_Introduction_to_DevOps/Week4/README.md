## Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:  
* Organizations need to have small, dedicated, cross-functional, self-organizing teams to successfully implement DevOps.
* Conway’s Law implies that a company’s design results are a direct reflection of the company’s communication structure.

* DevOps solves problems caused by siloed teams.
* DevOps is the practice of development and operations engineers working together during the entire software lifecycle, following lean and Agile principles that allow them to deliver high-quality results.
* Actions without consequences can lead to apathy.
* Allowing teams to feel the effect of their actions fosters empathy, resulting in higher-quality work.
* The organizational objective of DevOps is to attain a shared mindset and empower everyone to deliver customer value.

# Measuring DevOps
## Introduction
This module is all about measurements for DevOps. You will learn the importance of measuring what matters, such as social metrics and continuous improvement goals. You will see how measuring social metrics leads to improved teamwork and how measuring DevOps metrics allows you to see progress toward your goals. You will discover that actionable metrics help you take action toward your desired outcome. One of the key aspects of DevOps is creating a blameless culture. Measuring culture is critical for building a culture in which ideas flow openly and people are listened to. You will learn how that type of working culture can be created. You will see the disadvantages of rewarding one behavior while hoping for a different behavior.

## Learning Objectives
* Describe the effect on teams of rewarding for A while hoping for B.
* Describe how actionable metrics are commonly used in a DevOps environment.
* Describe how to measure culture.

## Activity
* [Activity: Defining Actionable Metrics](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBM-CS0191EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module_5/5.2%20Vanity%20Metrics%20versus%20Actionable%20Metrics/index.html)

## Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
* Measure and reward what you want to improve.  
* People seek information on what is rewarded and then seek to do that.
* Measuring social metrics leads to improved teamwork and measuring DevOps metrics allows you to see the progression toward your goals.
* If you want people to be social, then measure them being social.
* DevOps changes the objective of problem resolution from failure prevention to failure recovery.
* Vanity metrics may be appealing at first but offer limited actionable insights.
* Actionable metrics provide meaningful ways to measure your processes and take action toward goals.
* DevOps actionable metrics include mean lead time, release frequency, change failure rate, and mean time to recovery.
* You can rate statements developed by Dr. Nicole Forsgren to measure your team’s culture, including statements about information, failures, collaboration, and new ideas.
* Mean lead time is the measure of how long it takes for an idea to get to production.
* Change failure rate is the rate of failure from pushing new releases out.
* Mean time to recovery is how long it takes to recover from a failure.
* Failures are learning opportunities that should not be punished.
* Dr. Nicole Forsgren developed cultural statements for measuring team culture.

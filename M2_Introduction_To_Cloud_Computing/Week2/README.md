# Cloud Computing Models
## Introduction
This week you will learn about the different types of service and deployment models of cloud computing. In this module, you will learn about the three main service models available on the cloud—Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). You will also learn about the three main deployment models available on the cloud—Public, Private, and Hybrid. At the end of the module, you will create an account on IBM Cloud.

## Learning Objectives
* Describe the essential characteristics, use cases, and benefits of the three different types of cloud service models—IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS
* Describe the essential characteristics, use cases, and benefits of the three different types of cloud deployment models and their use cases
* Create an account on IBM Cloud

## Lesson Summaries
### Lesson Summary: Service Models
* Cloud computing allows us to utilize technology as a service, leveraging remote resources on-demand, on a pay-as-you-model. There are three main service models available on the cloud—Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Software-as-a-Service (SaaS).
* IaaS provides the fundamental compute, network, and storage resources for customers on-demand.
* PaaS provides customers the hardware, software, and infrastructure to develop, deploy, manage, and run applications created by them or acquired from a third-party.
* SaaS provides access to users to a service provider’s cloud-based software. Users simply access the applications on Cloud while the Cloud provider maintains the infrastructure, platform, data, application code, security, availability, and performance of the application.

### Lesson Summary: Deployment Models
* Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it, and how cloud resources and services are made available to users. There are three main deployment models available on the cloud—Public, Private, and Hybrid.
* In the Public cloud model, the service provider owns, manages, provisions, and maintains the physical infrastructure such as data centers, servers, networking equipment, and storage, with users accessing virtualized compute, networking and storage resources as services.
* In the Private cloud model, the provider provisions the cloud infrastructure for exclusive use by a single organization. The private cloud infrastructure can be internal to the organization and run or on-premises. Or, it can be on a public cloud, as in case of Virtual Private Clouds (VPC) and be owned, managed, and operated by the cloud provider.
* In the Hybrid cloud model, an organization’s on-premise private cloud and third-party, public cloud is connected as a single, flexible infrastructure leveraging the features and benefits of both Public and Private clouds.

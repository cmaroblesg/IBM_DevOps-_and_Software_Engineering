# Emergent Trends and Practices
## Introduction
This week you will learn about some of the emergent trends in cloud computing, such as Hybrid Multicloud, Serverless Computing, and Microservices. You will also learn about how cloud native applications work, the role of DevOps in addressing some of the complexities of cloud computing, and the components of application modernization.

### Learning Objectives
* Describe the characteristics, use cases, and advantages of some of the emergent cloud trends such as Hybrid Multicloud, Microservices, and Serverless computing
* Summarize the key concepts, development principles, use cases, and benefits of cloud native applications
* Describe the DevOps process and explain how it helps tackle some of the complexities and challenges posed by the cloud
* Explain the benefits of application modernization and how organizations can modernize their applications

## Lesson Summaries
### Lesson Summary: Hybrid Multi-Cloud, Microservices, and Serverless
* Hybrid Multicloud is a cloud adoption strategy that makes it possible for public clouds, private clouds, and on-premises IT to interoperate seamlessly while leveraging the best cloud-based services from different public cloud providers.
* Microservices architecture is an approach in which an application is built as a collection of loosely coupled and independently deployable components or services, leading to efficient development, maintenance, and upgradation cycles.
* Serverless Computing is an approach to computing that offloads responsibility for common infrastructure management tasks for application runtimes to cloud providers, allowing developers to focus their time and effort on development and testing, and not have to worry about provisioning, maintaining and scaling compute resources.

### Lesson Summary: Cloud Native Applications, DevOps, and Application Modernization
* Cloud native applications are applications that are built or refactored to work in the cloud environment. These applications, developed using DevOps methodologies, consist of microservices packaged in containers that can run in any environment—making it possible to create and update features in quick iterative cycles.
* DevOps is a collaborative approach that enables development and operations teams to continuously deliver software in quick iterative cycles while reducing overhead, duplication, and rework. DevOps’ tools, practices, and processes help tackle the complexities and challenges posed by the cloud, allowing solutions to be delivered and updated —quickly and reliably.
* Application Modernization helps organizations accelerate their digital transformation, take advantage of new technologies and services, and become more responsive to changing market dynamics. Cloud computing is one of the key enablers of application modernization.

# Introduction to Agile and Scrum
## Introduction
In this module, you will be introduced to the philosophy and characteristics of Agile. You will learn about other methodologies including Waterfall, Extreme Programming (XP) and Kanban, and how they relate to Agile. You’ll explore the five practices of working Agile. Next, you’ll get an overview of Scrum as a framework for applying Agile principles to project management. You’ll learn how Scrum benefits the project management process by advocating defined roles, events, and artifacts. You’ll learn how companies can organize for success using Agile, and how team alignment and autonomy contribute to building better systems. You’ll also learn how to recognize and avoid Agile anti-patterns and measure Scrum team health.

## Learning Objectives
* Define Agile as a philosophy and list its key principles.
* Describe approaches to software development including waterfall, Extreme Programming (XP), and Kanban, and how they relate to Agile.
* Explain the 5 practices of working Agile.
* Describe the key characteristics and steps of Scrum.

## Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
* Agile is an iterative approach to software development that emphasizes flexibility, interactivity, and transparency using small, cross-functional teams
* The Agile Manifesto describes the core values of Agile:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools\
- Working software over comprehensive documentation\
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation\
- Responding to change over following a plan
* The waterfall approach is a structured, step-by-step process that can lead to problems not surfaced until later in development
* Extreme Programming (XP) advocated an iterative approach that valued simplicity, communication, feedback, respect, and courage
* A Kanban system is characterized by visualizing workflow, limiting work in progress, managing and enhancing flow, making process policies explicit, and continuously improving a process
* Working in small batches means delivering something useful quickly
* An MVP is the cheapest/easiest thing you can do to test a hypothesis and learn
* Behavior Driven Development makes sure you are building the right thing
* Test Driven Development makes sure you are building the thing right
* Pair programming enables you to discover defects earlier and increase your code quality
* The Gherkin syntax, which comes from a company called Cucumber, is a single syntax that developers and stakeholders can understand: given some set of preconditions, when an event occurs, then some outcome is observed.

# Introduction to Scrum Methodology
## Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
* Scrum is a methodology that follows the Agile philosophy
* The Scrum management framework:
  * Provides structure through defined roles, meetings, rules, and artifacts
  * Prescribes small, cross-functional, self-organizing teams
  * Uses fixed-length iterations called sprints
  * Produces a potentially shippable product increment with every iteration
* The product owner represents stakeholders, articulates the product vision, and decides priorities, requirements, and readiness to ship
* The scrum master coaches the team, promotes a cooperative environment, shields the team from interference, and unblocks impediments
* The scrum team is small, dedicated, co-located, cross-functional, and self-managing
* The scrum team negotiates commitments with the product owner — one sprint at a time
* The scrum team has autonomy regarding how to reach commitments
* Scrum produces a product backlog, a sprint backlog, and a completed — or done — increment
* The Scrum events are sprint planning, daily Scrum meetings, sprints, sprint reviews, and sprint retrospectives

If done well, Scrum can:
* Increase employee productivity and happiness
* Improve product quality
* Reduce time to market
* Enhance stakeholder satisfaction

# Organizing for Success
## Summary and Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
* How you are organized can affect the systems that you build.
* Giving teams autonomy leads to motivated teams who can execute faster and build better systems
* Not adopting Agile across your organization can lead to operational bottlenecks
* Many companies adhere to their waterfall planning and call it Agile
* Simply doing iterative development is not Agile unless you are being responsive to changes and delivering value often

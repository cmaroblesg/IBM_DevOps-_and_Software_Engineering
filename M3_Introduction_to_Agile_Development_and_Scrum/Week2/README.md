# Agile Planning
## Introduction
In this module, you will learn more details about Agile iterative planning. You will also learn how to create good user stories, estimate and assign story points, build and refine a product backlog, and build a sprint plan.

## Learning Objectives
* Describe the sprint planning process.
* Explain how to build and refine the backlog.
* Describe a good user story.
* Define a kanban board and explain how work flows across the board as it is completed.
* Articulate why iterative planning is more accurate than up-front planning.

## Laboratories
* [**Hands-on Lab 1:** Get set up in ZenHub](./files/lab1-get-set-up-in-zenhub.pdf)
* [**Hands-on Lab 2:** Create an issue template in GitHub](./files/lab2-create-story-template.pdf)
* [**Hands-on Lab 3:** Assemble your Product Backlog](./files/lab3-assemble-product-backlog.pdf)
* [**Hands-on Lab 4:** Refine your Product Backlog](./files/lab4-refine-your-product-backlog.pdf)
* [**Hands-on Lab 5:** Build the Sprint Plan from your Product Backlog](./files/lab5-build-a-sprint-plan.pdf)

## Summary and Highlights - **Planning to be Agile**
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
* Planning everything at the beginning of a project can lead to missed deadlines
* Iterative planning allows for course corrections and more accurate estimates
* Placing existing people in new roles without the proper training will lead to failure because Agile roles need a different focus and new priorities
* To be successful, the Agile mindset must be adopted by user management
* A kanban board is a way of tracking plan items needing to be done, items in process, and completed items
* A kanban board is made of multiple pipelines
* Work moves from left to right on the kanban board as it is completed

## Summary and Highlights - **User Stories**
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:  
* A user story documents a person requesting a function to achieve a goal.
* Using a template helps ensure that stories are complete.
* Defining "done" helps minimize misunderstandings.
* Use the INVEST acronym to remember the qualities of a good user story: independent, negotiable, valuable, estimable, small, and testable.
* Epics can be used to capture big ideas.
* Story points are a metric used to estimate the difficulty of implementing a given user story.
* Story points are relative, like T-Shirt sizes.
* You must agree on what "average" means.
* You should never equate story points with wall-clock time.
* A product backlog is a ranked list of all unimplemented stories.
* Stories high in the ranking should have more detail than those that are lower.
* Create stories using the "As a", "I need", "So that" template to ensure everyone understands who it benefits and the business value it provides.

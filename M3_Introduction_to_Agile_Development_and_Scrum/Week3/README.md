# Daily Execution
## Introduction
This module describes the daily workflow for executing a sprint plan, including how to determine which story to work on and how to keep the team updated on progress. You will learn what a daily stand-up is and how to run one. You’ll learn how to use burndown charts to forecast the team’s ability to achieve the sprint goal. You’ll learn how to conduct the sprint review and the sprint retrospective. And you’ll find out how to measure success and use actionable metrics to improve the team’s performance.

## Learning Objectives
* Discuss Scrum anti-patterns and how to measure the health of a scrum team.
* Explain how to use metrics to effectively measure and improve a team’s performance.
* Describe sprint meetings and how to conduct them.
* Explain how to use a burndown chart to help forecast the ability to achieve a sprint goal.
* Describe the daily workflow, including the daily stand-up meeting.

## Summary and Highlights - **Executing the Plan**
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
* You need to keep the kanban board updated so that everyone knows what you are working on
* It is important to always work on the story with the highest priority that you have skills for
* Working on more than one story at a time may lead to neither story being finished at the end of the sprint
* The daily stand-up occurs every day for 15 minutes
* Topics not related to the stand-up should be addressed after the meeting
* Each person should be prepared to answer the three stand-up questions:
  * What did I accomplish the previous day?
  * What will I work on today?
  * What blockers or impediments are in my way?

## Summary and Highlights - **Completing the Sprint**
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:
* A burndown chart shows the measurement of story points completed vs story points remaining for a sprint
* Burndown charts can be used to show progress and forecast the team's probability of achieving the sprint goal
* A sprint review is a demonstration of the features that have been implemented during the sprint
* Feedback from stakeholders is critical to help shape the future of the product
* The backlog is updated based on feedback
* A sprint retrospective is a time to reflect on how the sprint went
* The sprint retrospective is attended by the scrum master and the development team
* The team must feel comfortable to speak freely
* A sprint retrospective must result in changes to improve the next sprint
* Three questions are answered on what went right or wrong:
  * What went well? (keep doing)
  * What did not go well? (stop doing)
  * What should we change for the next sprint?

## Summary and Highlights - **Measuring Success**
Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know:  
* High performing teams use metrics to continually improve
* It is important to be sure that the metrics you use are actionable
* You should take a baseline before trying to measure change.
* It is important to give developers credit for unfinished stories
* Unfinished stories should be split into new stories to complete the work in the next sprint
* Each sprint milestone should be closed when completed to reflect the velocity of the sprint
* You should create a new milestone for the next sprint
* The top 4 actionable metrics can be used to improve your team’s overall performance
  * Mean Lead Time (How long does it take from idea to production?)
  * Release Frequency (How often can you deliver changes?)
  * Change Failure Rate (How often do changes fail?)
  * Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR) (How quickly can you recover from failure?)
* Anti-patterns to avoid when practicing Scrum include:
  * No real product owner
  * Teams are too large
  * Teams are not dedicated
  * Teams are too geographically distributed
  * Teams are siloed
  * Teams are not self-managing
* The Scrum health check provides guidelines for measuring a healthy scrum team

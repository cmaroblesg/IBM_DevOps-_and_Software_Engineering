# Introduction to Linux
## Introduction
Linux is one of the most popular operating systems with a large user-base of developers and programmers. Linux has been around since the 1990s and has reached a user-base that spans around the world. Linux is everywhere. It is in your phones, your thermostats, and in your cars. In this module, you will learn about the history of Linux, its various distributions and the standard architecture that they all use, and how you can use the Linux terminal and shell to interact with your Linux system. You will also learn how to create and edit text files and explore how to update and install software on your system.

## Learning Objectives
* Summarize the origins of the Linux operating system and list its key features and use cases.
* Describe what a Linux distribution is, list several popular distributions, and indicate their key distinguishing characteristics.
* Explain the Linux architecture and describe the role of each layer in a Linux system.
* Interact with a Linux system using the terminal and navigate directories using paths and shortcuts.
* Create and edit text files using nano and vi editors.
* Use a software package manager to install software and updates on a Linux system.

## Summary & Highlights
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point, you know:
* Linux originated in the 1990s when Linus Torvalds developed a free, open source version of the Unix kernel.
* Linux is multi-user, portable, and supports multitasking.
* Linux is widely used today in mobile devices, desktops, supercomputers, data centers, and cloud servers.
* Linux distributions (also known as distros) differ by their UIs, shell, applications, and how the OS is supported and built.
* The design of a distro is catered toward its specific audience and/or use case.
* Popular Linux distributions include Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), Debian, Ubuntu, Suse (SLES, SLED, OpenSuse), Fedora, Mint, and Arch.
* The Linux system consists of five key layers: user, application, OS, kernel, and hardware.
* The kernel is the lowest-level software and it enables applications to interact with your hardware.
* The shell is an OS-level application for running commands.
* You use a terminal to send commands to the shell.
* You can use the cd command to navigate around your Linux filesystem.
* You can use a variety of command-line or GUI-based text editors such as GNU nano, vim, vi, and gedit.
* Deb and RPM packages contain software updates and installation files.
* You can use GUI-based and command-line package managers to update and install software on Linux systems.

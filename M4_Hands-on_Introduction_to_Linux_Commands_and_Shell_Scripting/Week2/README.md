## Course Introduction
A shell is a powerful user interface for Unix-like operating systems. It can interpret commands and run other programs. It also enables access to files, utilities, and applications, and is an interactive scripting language. Additionally, you can use a shell to automate tasks. Linux shell commands are used for navigating and working with files and directories. You can also use them for file compression and archiving.

In this short course, you will learn about the characteristics of Linux commands and shell scripting. You will explore the different Linux commands and their outputs, Bash scripting, and how to schedule jobs using crontab. You will learn how to work with filters, pipes, and variables.

In case you require any assistance while completing the course we encourage you to post on the course discussion forums that are monitored by the course team.

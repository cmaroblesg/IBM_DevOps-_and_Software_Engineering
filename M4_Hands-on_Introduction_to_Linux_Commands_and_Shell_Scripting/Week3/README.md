# Introduction to Shell Scripting
## Introduction
A shell is a powerful user interface for Unix-like operating systems. It can interpret commands and run other programs. It also enables access to files, utilities, and applications, and is an interactive scripting language. Additionally, you can use a shell to automate tasks. Linux shell commands are used for navigating and working with files and directories. You can also use them for file compression and archiving. In this module, you will learn about the characteristics of shell scripting. You will explore the different Linux commands and their outputs, Bash scripting, and how to schedule jobs using crontab. You will learn how to work with filters, pipes, and variables.

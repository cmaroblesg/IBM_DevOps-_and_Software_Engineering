# Using Git Commands and Managing GitHub Projects
## Introduction
Branches are the heart of workflows in Git-based version control systems like GitHub. In this module you will become familiar with creating and using branches, and merging your changes to the main branch with Pull Requests. As you start working with GitHub repositories and automating workflows, using the web interface can be limiting and more time-consuming. This is where Git commands come in. You can use from your own desktop or a Cloud IDE - wherever you develop your code. In this module you will also become familiar with and utilize various Git commands to clone and fork repositories, as well as commit, push and pull your changes using the command line.

## Learning Objectives
* Explain how branches are used and describe pull requests.
* Describe the function of Git commands like push, pull, and fetch.
* Differentiate between cloning and forking GitHub projects.
* List the roles common in large projects.
* Execute Git commands to work with GitHub repositories from a terminal.
* Create a fork and clone of a GitHub repository, make code changes, and submit a pull request.
* Create GitHub branches and perform merge operations using the GitHub Web interface.

## Module Summary
In this module, you learned that:
* Branches are used to isolate changes to code. When the changes are complete, they can be merged back into the main branch.
* Repositories can be cloned to make it possible to work locally, then sync changes back to the original.
* Repositories can be forked to be used as a base for a new project, or so that the developer can work independently.
* A​ Pull Request (PR) can be submitted to have your changes reviewed and merged.
* Large projects include people working in different roles:
* Developer – creates code
* Integrator – manages changes made by developers
* Repository Administrator – configures and maintains access to the repository

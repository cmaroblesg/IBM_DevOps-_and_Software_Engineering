**Estimated time**: 15 minutes

## Prerequisites

This hands-on lab requires you to have already generated an SSH key. See the [Generating an SSH key](SSH_Key.md.html) lab for instructions.

## Steps

To add an SSH key to GitHub, you need to copy the SSH key that you generated in the previous lab. Open a terminal and then complete the following steps:

1.  In the terminal, run the following command:

    `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | clip`

    **Note**: If `clip` doesn't work, run `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` in the command line and the copy the output.

2.  Sign in to GitHub. At the top right, click the drop-down menu on your profile image and select **Settings**.

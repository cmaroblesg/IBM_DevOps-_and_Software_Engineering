## About this Course
This mini-course is intended to apply foundational Python skills by implementing different techniques to develop applications and AI powered solutions. Assume the role of a developer and unit test and package an application with the help of multiple hands-on labs. After completing this course you will have acquired the confidence to begin developing AI enabled applications using Python, build and run unit tests, and package the application for distribution.

### PRE-REQUISITE:
**Python for Data Science, AI and Development** course from IBM is a pre-requisite for this project course. Please ensure that before taking this course you have either completed the Python for Data Science, AI and Development course from IBM or have equivalent proficiency in working with Python and data.

**NOTE:** This course is not intended to teach you Python and does not have too much instructional content. It is intended for you to apply prior Python knowledge.

## Syllabus
### [**Week 1:** Python - Unit testing, module packaging and web application development](./Week1/README.md)
In this module, you will be introduced to the process of packaging, unit testing in Python and Flask, a microweb framework, the creation of web applications using flask. Packaging allows the Cloud Application Developer to produce a coding unit that can be tested and integrated into a codebase. Unit testing assures that code is error-free and integrates properly within a larger project. Flask is an open-source python package that allows you to create web applications.

### [**Week 2:** Final Assignment - Python Web Application](./Week2/README.md)

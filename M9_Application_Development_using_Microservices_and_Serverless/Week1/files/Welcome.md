# Welcome to Application Development using Microservices and Serverless
Welcome to this introductory course on microservices and serverless. My name is Alex Parker. 

This course is designed for all kinds of Cloud practitioners, including anyone who wants to design, develop, deploy, manage or secure applications and solutions on public, private or hybrid cloud platforms. By the end of this course, you will have a solid foundation for microservices and serverless and will have deployed microservices on the cloud and integrated them with serverless compute.

The emergence of cloud computing has brought about a lot of changes to modern software development. Rather than large annual releases on physical mediums like CDs, modern software is increasingly released on the cloud, provided cost reduction, decreased time to market, and increased agility. These changes allow organizations to keep pace with their competitors and bring new innovations to market in ways that previously would have been unthinkable.

In addition to methodologies like agile and DevOps, microservices have emerged as an architectural model suited for cloud development. Rather than building large applications, known as monoliths, that perform all the functionality, microservices break down larger applications into smaller pieces that are independently maintainable and scalable, providing a host of benefits. This architecture is used at the largest software organizations in the world because it provides cost benefits, team autonomy, and so many other advantages.

Likewise, serverless has emerged as an increasingly popular compute option in the cloud era. Giving developers and operators the ability to run applications without managing underlying infrastructure has freed up resources at organizations that can now focus on developing business logic and furthering the mission and goals of their organization, rather than having to maintain servers and complex infrastructure. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation—known as CNCF—conducts annual surveys to discern where and how cloud-native technologies are being adopted. The 2020 survey indicates that just under a third of respondents are already using serverless in production, with 21% evaluating it and 14% planning to use it in the next 12 months. Serverless is positioned to become an even larger force in cloud computing in the years ahead because of its myriad advantages, and understanding its purpose is vital for any cloud developer.

This course will introduce you to 12-factor apps and microservices, concepts that emerged to help organizations work better and faster in a cloud-native manner. You’ll then learn about serverless computing—how it works, what value it brings, and what are specific serverless technologies. You’ll get hands-on with IBM Cloud Functions, a serverless platform on IBM Cloud that lets you develop serverless apps with ease. And finally, you’ll learn about tools like Red Hat OpenShift and service meshes, which make the adoption of microservices easier and more secure.

The course contains several hands-on labs, which allow you to apply the content you learn. Don't worry if you don't have a machine with sufficient resources, as we provide a cloud-based environment at no charge for completing the hands-on labs.

The prerequisites for this course include basic computer and cloud literacy as well as an understanding of core cloud concepts. In addition, understanding of the command line and how to use shell commands will greatly benefit you during this course.

Let's get started!

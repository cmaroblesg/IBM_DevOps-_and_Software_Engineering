# Introduction to Serverless
## Introduction
Serverless, microservices, and functions are terms that often mistakenly spoken of interchangeably. For effective Cloud DevOps, you need knowledge about how each of these capabilities fit into cloud environments and the cloud application development process. Learn what serverless is. First explore how microservices differs from serverless. Next, take a deeper dive into the application time when you learn about Function as a Service (FaaS) and discover how FaaS compares to other cloud capabilities. Finally, expand your functions knowledge when you explore IBM Cloud Functions.

## Learning Objectives
* Define serverless computing and key serverless attributes
* Explain how serverless computing benefits developers
* Describe the benefits and challenges of serverless computing
* Define Function as a Service, describe Function as a Service capabilities and benefits, and explain the differences between Function as a Service and serverless
* Discuss why Function as a Service is a foundational technology in conjunction with the serverless stack
* Identify the benefits and drawbacks of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) compared to Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Containers and Virtual Machines
* Compare the benefits and drawbacks of Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) to Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), Containers, and Virtual Machines
* Discuss how serverless supports microservices architecture
* Describe key serverless use cases for data processing, massively parallel computing, and streaming processing workloads

## Summary
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know that:
* Serverless computing makes Infrastructure management for end users and enables developers to focus on their applications’ business-specific needs.
* Serverless code runs on-demand and scales transparently. On demand, pay-as-you-go server consumption means that organizations never pay for idle capacity.
* Serverless computing works well with microservices because services should perform a well-defined task and communicate via APIs. 
* Serverless is effective for data processing, massively parallel compute operations, and stream processing workloads. 
* Serverless is well-suited for spiky workloads that can afford some latency, but long-running applications are better run using other platforms. However, serverless can lead to vendor lock-in and doesn’t always support every programming language.
* Function as a Service, known as FaaS, a subset of serverless computing, is an event-driven computing execution model and like serverless, FaaS is ideal for spiky workloads, with pay-as-you-go capabilities. Highly available, microservices compatible, FaaS applications consist of stateless, scalable, customized containers
* FaaSprovides millisecond provisioning time and no administration. Compute models other than FaaScan give greater flexibility but require more cost and effort.
* IBM Cloud Functions is a FaaS service available on IBM Cloud. Within IBM Cloud, namespaces are the overarching entity where other Cloud Functions entities are stored. Packages let you integrate applications with capabilities from external services. Events are channeled through triggers, and rules associate those triggers with the actions that should occur.

# OpenShift Essentials/Working with OpenShift and Istio
## Introduction
Discover how Red Hat® OpenShift®, a container platform for Kubernetes, helps you automate the provisioning, management, and scaling of your Cloud applications. Explore what a service mesh is and how service meshes benefit organizations who are using microservices. Wrap up this module with an understanding of microservices on OpenShift.

## Learning Objectives
* Explain what Red Hat OpenShift is
* Describe the relationship between OpenShift and Kubernetes
* Identify the services OpenShift provides to facilitate operations and development tasks
* Describe the benefits and challenges of microservices
* Explain what a service mesh is and how a service mesh can alleviate common microservices challenges
* Discuss how microservices are deployed on OpenShift.

## Summary
Congratulations! You have completed this module. At this point in the course, you know that:
* Red Hat OpenShift is a platform for running containerized workloads like microservices.
* OpenShift is like a Kubernetes distribution in that OpenShift with additional capabilities. OpenShift services help manage workloads, build cloud-native apps, and increase developer productivity. For example, OpenShift creates a Jenkins job to automatically build microservices into containers. In addition, OpenShift pushes the built containers to a registry and deploys those containers to the cluster
* Microservices architectures need security among services as well as ways to manage and test services.
* A service mesh is a dedicated layer that provides security and more by coordinating communication. Istio is a service mesh that provides traffic shifting, mutual transport layer security, and telemetry when deployed with microservices. 
* Certified software fills development gaps in your application, eliminating the need for your organization to spend the time and money  to develop new microservices. Red Hat Marketplace provides a central location to try, buy, deploy and manage software certified for OpenShift environments.
